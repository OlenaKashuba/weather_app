# Weather App Project


## Goal of the app

Check 5 days **weather forecast in London**


## Core Functionality

The user of the app can easily get acess to 5 days London forecast display. Date, weather description, temperature and appropriate icon is available. The responsive design makes app convenient for using on any devices. 


## Research 

I've done the research through Google, comparing different app designs in order to find the simple but refined appealing idea for the basic version of the app 


##Target Audience 

Typical user of the app is a young specialist, who likes to plan in advance and be as ready as possible for different uncontrollable changes (like weather)


## Stretch goals

* create a city Seach to broaden the Tanget audience beyond londoners

* include the "use Current Location" option

* add night weather
